# Nicktionary

This is a Python clone of the game Wordle, written by Nicholas Boni, originally made by Josh Wardle.

The game updates the wordle every day, and will be playable until October 20, 2027.

# Installation

1. Click here: [releases](https://github.com/shmaller/nicktionary/releases).
2. On the latest version, under **Assets**, click `nicktionary.zip`.
3. Open it from your downloads folder.

**Note:** On Mac OS, you will probably get a warning about not being able to open the file because it is from an unknown developer. I swear, it's just me. To open the program:

1. **Control + Click** the file >> click **Open**. This should open the "Open anyway?" dialog.
2. Click **Open**.
3. Play the game!

# Supported OS
Currently only works on Mac (I think).
