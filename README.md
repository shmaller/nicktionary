# Wordle Clone

This is a Python clone of the game Wordle, written by Nicholas Boni, originally made by James Wardle.

The game updates the wordle every day, and will be playable until October 20, 2027.

# Installation

1. Click here: [`build`](https://github.com/shmaller/wordle-clone/tree/main/build#installation).
2. In that folder, click `wordle.zip`.
3. Click **Download Raw File**.
4. Open it from your downloads folder.

**Note:** On Mac OS, you may get a warning about not being able to open the file because it is from an unknown developer. I swear, it's just me. To open the program:

1. **Control + Click** the file. This should open the "Open anyway?" dialog.
2. Click **Open**.
3. Play the game!
