# Nicktionary

This is a Python clone of the game Wordle, written by Nicholas Boni, originally made by Josh Wardle.

The game updates the wordle every day, and will be playable until October 20, 2027.

# Installation
## Mac OS
1. Click here: [releases](https://github.com/shmaller/nicktionary/releases).
2. Scroll down to **Assets**, and click `nicktionary_macos.zip`.
3. Open it from your downloads folder.

At this point, you will probably get warning about not being able to open the file because it is from an unknown developer. I swear, it's just me. To open the program:

4. **Control + Click** the file >> **Open**. This should open the "Open anyway?" dialog.
5. Click **Open**.
6. Play the game!

## Windows
1. Click here: [releases](https://github.com/shmaller/nicktionary/releases).
2. Scroll down to **Assets**, and click `nicktionary_windows.zip`.
3. Find it in your downloads folder, and **Right-Click >> Extract All**.
4. Open the new folder `nicktionary`, and run `nicktionary.exe`.

At this point, you will probably get a message that says something like, "Microsoft Defender SmartScreen prevented an unrecognized app from starting. Running this app might put your PC at risk." I swear, it's just me. To open the program:

5. Click **More Info >> Run anyway**.
6. Play the game!
